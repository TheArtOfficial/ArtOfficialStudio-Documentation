# Local Installation

## First Time Setup starts here

If your Nvidia Driver does not support cu128, there are other cuda versions available as well, if you need a different cuda version, please let me know! Not too difficult to create a new image.

`ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:latest`

`ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:cu126latest`

`ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:cu125latest`

`ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:cu124latest`

Nvidia 50xx series requires cu128, which is why that is my official release. Drivers are backward compatible, so there is no reason not to update to the latest driver that supports the latest CUDA version. But for those who cannot, the cu126 or cu125 version should work the same.

## What is Docker? (Beginner Friendly)

Docker is like a virtual box that runs software in isolated environments called containers. These containers come pre-packaged with all dependencies.

Think of it like this:

1. You download an "app box"
2. You run the box
3. The app inside just works — no installs, no errors, no dependencies

## How to Install Docker with GPU Support (One-time setup)

### Windows (with WSL2 and NVIDIA GPU)

**Click the image below for windows install tutorial:**

[![Windows Install Guide for ArtOfficial Studio](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Na5BEQWFmic/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Na5BEQWFmic)

This guide will walk you through setting up Docker Desktop on Windows with WSL 2 to enable GPU acceleration for ArtOfficial Studio. This allows ArtOfficial Studio to leverage your NVIDIA graphics card for AI tasks.

**Prerequisites:**

-   A Windows machine (Windows 10 version 21H2 or higher, or Windows 11).
-   An NVIDIA GPU (Pascal architecture or newer recommended).
-   Administrator privileges on your Windows machine.

**Step 1: Install/Update NVIDIA Windows Drivers**

**This step isn't necessary if you already have your GPU drivers working.** Your Windows NVIDIA drivers are what WSL 2 and Docker will use for GPU access. 

1.  Download the official NVIDIA APP [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/]
2.  Download the latest **Game Ready Driver** or **NVIDIA Studio Driver** suggested for you in the app.
3.  Restart your computer if prompted.
4.  **Verify Driver Installation (Windows):** Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type `nvidia-smi`. You should see details about your NVIDIA GPU.
5.  **Restart Docker Desktop (if already installed):** If you already have Docker Desktop installed, restart it after updating your NVIDIA drivers to ensure it recognizes the new driver version.


**Step 2: Install or Enable WSL 2**

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows. WSL 2 offers better performance and full system call compatibility, which is necessary for Docker and GPU support.

1.  **Install WSL & a Linux Distribution (e.g., Ubuntu):**
    Open PowerShell or Command Prompt **as Administrator** and run:
    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```
    This command will enable necessary Windows features, download the latest Linux kernel, set WSL 2 as your default, and install a Linux distribution (usually Ubuntu).
2.  Restart your computer if prompted.
3.  **Update WSL (if already installed):**
    If you had WSL previously installed, ensure it's up to date:
    ```powershell
    wsl --update
    ```
4. **If Ubuntu does not automatically install:**
    Install it with:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
    ```
6.  **Verify WSL Installation:**
    Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
    ```bash
    wsl -l -v
    ```
    You should see your installed Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) listed with `VERSION` as `2`. If it's version 1, you may need to convert it (e.g., `wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2`).


**Step 3: Verify WSL Has GPU Access**

Do NOT install standard Linux NVIDIA drivers inside WSL.

1.  **Open your WSL Linux Terminal:**
    Type `wsl` or the name of your distribution (e.g., `ubuntu`) in PowerShell or Command Prompt or open an Ubuntu Terminal from windows start menu

2.  **Verify `nvidia-smi` in WSL:**
    Run:
    ```bash
    nvidia-smi
    ```
    You should see details about your NVIDIA GPU.


**Step 4: Install Docker Desktop for Windows**

1.  Download Docker Desktop from the official website: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2.  Run the installer. During installation, ensure you **select the "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V (recommended)" option** if prompted, or ensure it's configured to use the WSL 2 backend.
3.  After installation, Docker Desktop might require a restart.


**Step 5: Configure Docker Desktop for WSL Integration**

1.  Start Docker Desktop.
2.  Open Docker Desktop **Settings** (usually by clicking the gear icon in the top right).
3.  Go to **Resources > WSL Integration**.
4.  Ensure "Enable integration with my default WSL distro" is checked.
5.  In the list below ("Enable integration with additional distros"), make sure the toggle for your installed Linux distribution (e.g., `Ubuntu`) is **ON**.
    ![Docker WSL Integration Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce7ecd0-d591-4ecd-a7ad-9c526bb8523d)
6.  Click "Apply & Restart" if you made any changes.


**Step 6: Verify GPU Access in Docker**

This step confirms Docker can use your GPU via WSL 2.

1.  Open a new PowerShell, Command Prompt, or your WSL Linux terminal.
2.  Run the following command. Use a CUDA version tag that is compatible with your Windows NVIDIA driver's supported CUDA version (e.g., if `nvidia-smi` in Windows/WSL showed CUDA 12.9, use a `12.9.x` or earlier tag):
    ```bash
    docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.5.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
    ```
    _(You can find available `nvidia/cuda` tags on Docker Hub. For example, if your driver supports CUDA 12.9, `nvidia/cuda:12.9.0-base-ubuntu22.04` would be suitable)._
3.  If this command runs successfully and outputs the `nvidia-smi` details from _within the container_, your Docker GPU setup is working! If you see errors, re-check the previous steps, especially Windows NVIDIA drivers, WSL `nvidia-smi` functionality, and Docker Desktop WSL integration settings.


**Step 7: Troubleshooting Speed & Performance Issues in Windows**

Only use this step if you are having performance issues. For some reason docker-desktop typically only wants to use half of available resources. In this case, we need to create a .wslconfig file.
1. Create a .wslconfig file in your C:/Users/\<Username\> folder
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/494df023-47b5-4330-8de2-bfe3c7d70d9e)
2. Check your Task Manager > Performance Tab for the Max RAM and Processors that you have available (in this case I have 32 processors and 93.6GB RAM)
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2e36245-7206-46aa-a0ad-f72c690cb63d)
3. Write the following in your .wslconfig file:
   ```bash
    [wsl2]
    memory=<YourMaxRAM-10>GB
    processors=<YourMaxProcessors>
    ```
4. For example, for my stats, my .wslconfig file looks like:
   ```bash
    [wsl2]
    memory=80GB
    processors=32
    ```

**You are now ready to proceed with running the ArtOfficial Studio image!**

## First Time Setup Ends Here


---

## ArtOfficial Studio Windows Auto-Launcher

**If you want to just run an automated script, just download the start_aos.bat file at the top of the page and follow the instructions inside it! This will automate all the commands below for you, just remember to change "/home/theartofficial/comfyvol" to use your username.**

**DO NOT USE A WINDOWS PATH MOUNT. The Windows Path is multiple times slower than using the WSL Subsystem Path. If you want access to the linux files on Windows, either use JupyterLab through the "App Links" tab on ArtOfficial Studio, or go to the path `\\wsl$\Ubuntu` in File Explorer on Windows.**

Link: [start_aos.bat](https://github.com/TheArtOfficial/ArtOfficialStudio-Documentation/blob/main/start_aos.bat)


## Download the Docker Image

To deploy the container faster locally, it is best practice to download the container first and then run it locally. do so with this command:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:latest
```


## Mounting a Volume Drive to Persist Data

Docker is able to use your hard drive to store all of the contianer data. The contianer is set up so all of the important ComfyUI and Training Tool data goes into the "/workspace" folder, so that is where we want to mount our volume. Make sure you do not change the :/workspace part of the command, only change the path for your volume.

If you are running on Windows, make sure to use a path from inside the WSL distro. If you mount to a windows volume path, you **will** experience performance issues and slow loading times. These issues are completely eliminated by using a path inside WSL

When you first start WSL, it will be completely empty, as shown by the first "ls" command. "ls" just lists the files that are in the file system.
create a folder inside WSL with the "mkdir" command. In this case, I used "mkdir comfyvol"
Now when we run "ls" we can see the comfyvol folder. This will be the folder we mount our docker image too so that we can persist the data.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ef75baa-585e-43ed-80a6-0a34755bebbe)


## How to Run the ArtOfficial Studio Docker Image

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  --shm-size=32g \
  -it \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v /home/theartofficial/comfyvol:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:latest
```

Replace the "/home/theartofficial/comfyvol" path with your actual folder location. Should be exactly the same, but replace "theartofficial" with your linux username.

Access via browser:  
http://localhost:80


---

## How to Restart the Docker Image Without Losing Data

Clean up:

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

Then rerun the same Docker command as before.

You're all set! Dive into ArtOfficial Studio and explore the frontier of AI creation.

## How to Update your Docker Image to the Latest

Just run the pull command again

```
docker pull ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:latest
```

Running the container without pulling it will still update ComfyUI and all custom nodes, but you won't have any of the new ArtOfficial Studio features released, so if you want to try out a new model or new training too that's been released, make sure to pull the image again.

## Run the Container Again

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  --shm-size=32g \
  -it \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v /home/theartofficial/comfyvol:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/theartofficial/artofficialstudio:latest
```

Replace the "/home/theartofficial/comfyvol" path with your actual folder location. Should be exactly the same, but replace "theartofficial" with your linux username.

Access via browser:  
http://localhost:80

# Runpod Installation

If your pod's driver does not support cu128, there are other versions available.

To filter Pods by cuda version, use this dropdown (Cu12.8 Template won't work with Pods that have <=Cu12.7):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a879c6-140a-44f3-a678-e5287892acaa)

## How to Install the Container on a Cloud GPU with RunPod (Process for other cloud services should be similar)

**A warning before we begin, this does take longer to start than most Comfy Templates on RunPod, but that is because it gives you EVERYTHING you need. From Lora training tools, to Sageattention, to Controlnets, you won't have to search around the internet to find projects, nodes or models, so although the startup time is high, it will save you time overall.**

### 1. Go to RunPod:

-   Sign in to your account at [RunPod.io](https://runpod.io).

### 2. Select Proper Cuda Version Template

Cu12.8: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=xhqk6am365&ref=sibibj3j

Cu12.6: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=gyub8b38nt&ref=sibibj3j

Cu12.5: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=w15kdsstbq&ref=sibibj3j

Cu12.4: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=6pa9vb4956&ref=sibibj3j


### 7. Deploy On-Demand:

-   Click **Deploy On-Demand**. You should see the logs start to run.
-   If you encounter an error such as "No container found," this may indicate a network or setup issue with the pod.

### 8. Verify Logs:

-   Once successful, your system logs should indicate that everything is running, and you'll see messages like "downloading ------>" if it's your first time using the template.
-   If you see an "unauthorized" error, this means the credentials are incorrect or access hasn't been granted yet.
